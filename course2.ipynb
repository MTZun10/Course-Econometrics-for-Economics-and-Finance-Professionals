    "# Gauss-Markov Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Gauss-Markov Theorem** is a fundamental result in statistics and econometrics. It states that under certain assumptions, the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** estimator is the **Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE)** for the coefficients in a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms in the Gauss-Markov Theorem\n",
    "- **Best**: The estimator has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators.\n",
    "- **Linear**: The estimator is a linear function of the observed data.\n",
    "- **Unbiased**: The expected value of the estimator equals the true value of the parameter:\n",

    "## Assumptions for the Gauss-Markov Theorem\n",
    "For the OLS estimator to be BLUE, the following assumptions must hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity of the Model**:\n",
    "   - The regression model is:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Y = X\\beta + \\epsilon\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Where:\n",

    "     - $ X $: Independent variables (matrix of size $ n \\times k $).\n",
    "     - $ \\beta $: Coefficient vector ($ k \\times 1 $).\n",
    "     - $ \\epsilon $: Error term ($ n \\times 1 $).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full Rank of $ X $**:\n",
    "   - The independent variables are linearly independent, ensuring the matrix $ X'X $ is invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Mean of Errors**:\n",
    "   - The error term has an expected value of zero:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     E(\\epsilon) = 0\n",
    "     $$\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "     Where $ I $ is the identity matrix.\n",

    "     Cov(\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon_j) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Non-Stochastic Regressors**:\n",
    "   - The independent variables $ X $ are fixed in repeated samples (or independent of the errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statement of the Gauss-Markov Theorem\n",
    "Under these assumptions:\n",
    "- The OLS estimator:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\hat{\\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'Y\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  is **BLUE**:\n",
    "  - **Best**: It has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators.\n",
    "  - **Linear**: It is a linear function of $ Y $.\n",
    "  - **Unbiased**: Its expected value equals the true value of the parameter ($ E(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\beta $).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition Behind the Gauss-Markov Theorem\n",
    "1. **Unbiasedness**:\n",
    "   - The OLS estimator accurately reflects the true relationship between the variables on average.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Among all linear and unbiased estimators, OLS has the smallest variance, meaning it produces the most precise estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Impact**:\n",
    "   - The OLS estimator is reliable and robust when the assumptions hold, making it a cornerstone of regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happens If Assumptions Are Violated?\n",
    "1. **Homoscedasticity Violated**:\n",
    "   - If the error variance is not constant (heteroscedasticity), OLS is still unbiased but no longer efficient.\n",
    "   - Alternative methods like **Generalized Least Squares (GLS)** are preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Autocorrelation**:\n",
    "   - If errors are correlated, OLS is unbiased but not efficient. Time-series models or corrections like **Newey-West standard errors** are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Misspecification**:\n",
    "   - If the model is misspecified or important variables are omitted, the OLS estimator becomes biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The Gauss-Markov Theorem is the foundation of linear regression analysis, justifying the use of OLS estimators under the specified assumptions. It ensures that OLS estimators are the best choice for estimating linear relationships, provided the assumptions hold. When the assumptions are violated, other methods or adjustments must be employed.\n"
